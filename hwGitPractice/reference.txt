Moving Files between Working Directory and Repository
(and undoing some of these commands)

git clone URL/SSH Key # Obtains the repository from GitHub and stores it
in the working directory
git pull # Update the repository in the working directory with files from
GitHub
git add # Adds files to the staging area
git commit -m # Records files added to staging area that will be pushed
git push # Pushes all files in staging area to repository on GitHub
git reset <file> # Undos git add <file>
git checkout HEAD <file> # Restores a file to how it was before the most recent
commit
git checkout SHA . # Restores all files to a version determined by the SHA

Viewing Data

git show SHA # Shows the data for a commit such as the SHA, author, date,
commit message, and changes made when files were committed 
git diff # See the difference between a file in the working directory and
the file in the staging area
git status # Check the status of all files (committed, new files made, 
difference between working directory and GitHub repository)
git log # Lists all commits made so far

What is SHA?
The SHA is basically a marker for each commit a user made.

Note:
For certain commands, there are really useful options/flags such as
for git add. git add . adds all files changed to the staging area
git commit -am '<message>' adds all files changes and commits them
with a message
git revert SHA does what git checkout SHA . does but without the period
